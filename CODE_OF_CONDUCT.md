# DataKind Code of Conduct

In order to ensure that all participants experience a positive and respectful DataKind community, we reinforce and protect our respectful and safe environment by requiring that all community members commit to a Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct demonstrates [DataKind’s values](https://www.datakind.org/our-story), as well as how we’re accountable to each other, in a way that promotes shared understanding. We also provide transparency on how to identify and address situations if there are concerns that this code has been breached. DataKind commits to enforcing our Code of Conduct and to periodically reviewing our Code of Conduct to ensure DataKind remains a safe environment. Our Code of Conduct applies to any interactions within the DataKind community including all events (in-person or virtual) hosted by DataKind, shared online spaces (email, Slack, etc.), social media, and external events where volunteers or staff are representing DataKind as a speaker.

## Expected Behaviors
One of our favorite mottos at DataKind is “be tough on ideas, gentle on people.” People are at the center of all that we do, so it’s critical that we have mutual respect for one another and aim to exemplify our core values. Whether in an in-person or virtual environment, we want to provide a space where people are able to express their skills, curiosity, perspectives, and personality. 

When you volunteer at DataKind, you aim to demonstrate our core values:

### Humanity
We believe that the top priority of data science and AI should be to improve quality of life for people.
* Data science should be used where it improves access to information and services. We prioritize projects where responsible data science or AI provide the most impactful interventions.
* We work together in ways that recognize our shared humanity, making space for connection, joy, trust, and rest.
* We believe that being clear is being kind. We are tough on ideas, but gentle on people. 

### Equity
We aspire to close gaps in information and access by tailoring our work to the needs and perspectives of the people who will use it.
* We co-develop the vision for how solutions will address community-identified needs, prioritizing groups that have historically been excluded from data science and AI. 
* We build partnerships for reciprocal learning and seek to amplify our complementary strengths. 
* We prioritize ethics, privacy, anti-racism, and risk management from the start of any data science and AI work. 

### Innovation
We bring curiosity and creativity to the world’s toughest challenges, building responsive tools and solutions with shared expertise. 
* We are nimble and adaptive, testing new approaches and generating insights. We aspire to continuous learning and free and responsible sharing.
* We design our work in collaboration with others, building shared buy-in and knowledge for maximum impact. We approach new topics and projects with humility, ready to admit when we're wrong and eager to thoughtfully change course. 
* We are rigorous and feedback-driven. We continually raise the bar for technical and ethical excellence.

## Unacceptable Behaviors
Discrimination and harassment based on race, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, abilities, physical appearances, socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, ages, religions, or beliefs are expressly prohibited in our community. As a member of the DataKind community, you agree **not** to:

* Make assumptions about a person’s level of expertise.
* Insult other people.
* Harass DataKind staff, volunteers, community members, or participants. Harassment includes things like:
  * Violent threats, actions, or language directed against another person
  * Intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography; inappropriate physical contacts
  * Discriminatory or derogatory language or actions 
  * Posting or use of sexual, discriminatory, or violent imagery, comments, jokes, or language
  * Unwelcome sexual attention
  * Bullying 
  * The use of inflammatory or off-topic language to provoke hostility or conflict instead of civil discourse (i.e. trolling)
  * Sustained disruption of an event
* Question or challenge someone’s self-identity or chosen labels 
* Purposely share any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent, except as necessary to protect people from intentional abuse
* Advocate for, or encourage, any of the above behavior
 
Any reported violation of the Code of Conduct will be reviewed and disciplinary action could include actions up to DataKind terminating collaboration and/or banning any future engagement activities.
